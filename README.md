# React Mini Gallery

## Description

- _Time spent learning bare basics of React: about 4 days_
- _Time to execute the project, start to finish: ~18 hours, because... CSS_

The goal of this project was very specific: to get practice with making components and passing props in React's workflow (in this case with only GET and PUT routes), and then to better comprehend conditional rendering within that greater process. For base requirements no database was involved, nor POST / DELETE functionality.

This was a challenging project for me in two ways:

- I'm not yet confident with React, so the actual functionality and structure were a lot to wrangle

- I probably spent as much time on trying to fix styling details as I did on the actual PUT request and conditional rendering

There are still some styling things that vex me, like the changing size of the div when 'flipping' the photos, but I'm otherwise quite happy with the result and the decent responsiveness of the page when resized. I especially like the hover-for-color css effect I learned to apply.
